MLBPool2 Rules and Point Values

MLBPool2 Rules
##############

Before the Major League Baseball season starts, you will make a total of 37 picks:

- Division winners, 2nd place and last place for all three divisions in both the American League and National League.
  (18 picks)

- Wild Card winners (2) from the AL and NL. (4 picks)

- Team with the most wins in each league. (2 picks)

- Team with the most losses in each league (2 picks)

- Individual hitting leaders in batting average, RBIs, and home runs for both the AL and NL. (6 picks)

- Individual pitching leaders in wins and ERA in both the AL and NL. (4 picks)

- Tiebreaker: How many wins will the Minnesota Twins finish with? (1 pick)


Changing your picks
-------------------

Before the season starts, you can change your picks as many times as you want without any penalty.

During the All-Star break starting Sunday night at 7pm EST until Thursday at 7pm EST following the All-Star game,
you can change up to 14 picks, except the tiebreaker pick. These picks will be worth half of the original points.
Unique points are still worth double.

You can only change your picks once during the All-Star break.

Individual Leaders
------------------

These are staggered to improve the odds of earning points. For example, you earn 30 points for the player with
the most home runs. If he is second in home runs, you earn 20 points. If he is third, you get 10 points.
You will choose an individual leader in each category for both leagues (AL and NL).

Double Points Bonus
-------------------

If two or less players make the same pick, you will be eligible for double points in that category.
For instance, if you are one of two players to pick Joe Mauer for home runs, and he somehow ends up in the mix,
you would earn 60 points instead of 30 (if he ends in 1st place), 40 instead of 20 (2nd place), or 20 instead of
10 (3rd place) **if no one else has chosen him**. This applies to all individual picks and you can earn points
(and double points if you are the only one to pick that player) if the player you choose finishes in first,
second or third. Team picks, such as the division winners, best record, or wildcard picks are not eligible
for the double points bonus.

If you and another MLBPool2 player have the same pick at the beginning of the season and one of you changes that
pick at the All-Star break, the original pick does not qualify for the double points bonus.

You can view your picks from your account page and there is a column that shows if your pick is unique and qualifies
for the double points bonus.  This is updated after the season starts and after the All-Star break ends.
Your unique picks could change at the All-Star break if someone selects a team or player that you originally had as
unique during the first half of the season.

Division Picks
--------------

For each division in the two leagues (American and National), pick which teams will come in first, second and last
place. If you pick the Boston Red Sox to come in first, and they finish first, you earn 50 points. You can pick the
same team multiple times. You could pick the Red Sox to finish first and second to hedge your bet. Three divisions
of three picks each:

+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Picks      | 1st Place | 2nd Place | 3rd Place |
+============+===========+===========+===========+
| AL East    | 50        | 30        | 20        |
+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| AL Central | 50        | 30        | 20        |
+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| AL West    | 50        | 30        | 20        |
+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| NL East    | 50        | 30        | 20        |
+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| NL Central | 50        | 30        | 20        |
+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| NL West    | 50        | 30        | 20        |
+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

Wildcard Picks
--------------
Pick two teams from each league that will make the playoff as a Wildcard.

+----------------+--------+
| Wildcard       | Points |
+================+========+
| AL Wildcard #1 |  10    |
+----------------+--------+
| AL Wildcard #2 |  10    |
+----------------+--------+
| NL Wildcard #1 |  10    |
+----------------+--------+
| NL Wildcard #2 |  10    |
+----------------+--------+

Individual Picks
----------------
Pick one player in each category that you believe will lead the league in a given category.
You will earn points if that player finishes first, second or third in his conference. If he doesn't, you earn
zero points. Ties use `standard competition ranking`_.  This means, for example,  if two players tie for the most
home runs, there would be no second place player.  It would be first, first, third.

The individual category picks are to be completed for players in both the American League and National League.

+---------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Individual Category | 1st Place | 2nd Place | 3rd Place |
+=====================+===========+===========+===========+
