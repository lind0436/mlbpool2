        <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>Before the Major League Baseball season starts, you will make the following picks for the season:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Division winners, 2nd place and last place for all three divisions in both the American League
                    and National League. (18 picks)</li>
                <li>Wild Card winners (2) from the AL and NL.  (4 picks)</li>
                <li>Team with the most wins in each league.  (2 picks)</li>
                <li>Team with the most losses in each league (2 picks)</li>
                <li>Individual hitting leaders in batting average, RBIs, and home runs for both the
                    AL and NL. (6 picks)</li>
                <li>Individual pitching leaders in wins and ERA in both the AL and NL. (4 picks)</li>
                <li>Tiebreaker: How many wins will the Minnesota Twins finish with? (1 pick)</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Changing your picks</h3>
                <p>Before the season starts, you can change your picks as many times as you want without any
                penalty.</p>
                <p>During the All-Star break from Sunday night until the first game after the All-Star Break,
                    you can change up to 14 picks, except the tiebreaker pick.
                    These picks will be worth half of the original points.
                    Unique points are still worth double.</p>
                <p>You can only change your picks <b>once</b> during the All-Star break.</p>
            <h3>Individual Leaders</h3>
                <p> These are staggered to improve the odds of earning points.
                    For example, you earn 30 points for the player with the most home runs.
                    If he is second in home runs, you earn 20 points.
                    If he is third, you get 10 points.  You will choose an individual leader in each category for
                    both leagues (AL and NL).</p>
            <h3>Double Points Bonus</h3>
                <p> If you are unique in your choice of any pick, you will be eligible for
                    double points in that category.  For instance, if you are the only person to pick Joe Mauer
                    for home runs, and he somehow ends up in the mix, you would earn 60 points instead of 30
                    (if he ends in 1st place), 40 instead of 20 (2nd place), or 20 instead of 10
                    <b>if no one else has chosen him</b>.  This applies to all individual picks and you can
                    earn points (and double points if you are the only one to pick that player) if the player
                    you choose finishes in first, second or third.  If you are the only player to pick
                    the Miami Marlins to finish first in the NL East, you would earn 100 points, instead of 50.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you and another MLBPool2 player have the same pick at the beginning of the season
                    and one of you changes that pick at the All-Star break, the original pick does not
                    become unique.</p>
                    <p>You can view your picks from your <a href="/account">account page</a> and there
                    is a column that shows if your pick is unique.  This is updated after the season starts and
                    after the All-Star break ends.  Your unique picks could change at the All-Star break if
                    someone selects a team or player that you originally had as unique during the first
                    half of the season.</p>

            <h2>Points Breakdown:</h2>

            <h3>Division picks</h3>
                <p>For each division in the two leagues (American and National), pick which teams will come in
                first, second and last place.  If you pick the Boston Red Sox to come in first,
                    and they finish first, you earn 50 points. You <strong>can</strong> pick
                    the same team multiple times.  You could pick the Red Sox to finish first
                    and second to hedge your bet.  Three divisions of three picks each:</p>
