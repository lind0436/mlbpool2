        <h1>About NFLPool</h1>
        <div>
            <p>MLBPool2 was originally created by Jason Theros.  MLBPool came to an end
            in 2011 and in 2013, a small group of friends resurrected it as MLBPool2.  (Original, huh?)  Unfortunately,
            we weren't as smart as Mr. Theros, who had created a website written in ASP which
            auto-updated the standings and the code was no longer available.
            This meant we had to do it by hand and published the results in
            a Google Doc.</p>

        <p>In 2015, the same group of friends decided to re-create the league, but for football.
            Like MLBPool2, the first two years of NFLPool featured all of the updates done by hand.
            In early 2016, looking for a hobby, I decided to learn <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>
            to automate the scoring process and to keep historical records. The NFLPool application launched in 2017
            and MLBPool2 is based on the NFLPool codebase.  You can learn more about NFLPool at
            <a href="https://nflpool.xyz">NFLPool.xyz</a>.
