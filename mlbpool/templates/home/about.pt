        <h1>About NFLPool</h1>
        <div>
            <p>NFLPool is based on MLBPool, originally created by Jason Theros.  MLBPool came to an end
            in 2011 and in 2013, a small group of friends resurrected it as MLBPool2.  (Original, huh?)  Unfortunately,
            we weren't as smart as Mr. Theros, who had created a website written in ASP which
            auto-updated the standings and the code was no longer available.
            This meant we had to do it by hand and published the results in
            a Google Doc on <a href="http://www.mlbpool2.com>">MLBPool2.com</a>.</p>

        <p>In 2015, the same group of friends decided to re-create the league, but for football.
            The major difference between MLBPool2 and NFLPool is that MLBPool2 allows you to
            change your picks at mid-season and NFLPool does not.  Like MLBPool2, the first two
            years of NFLPool featured all of the updates done by hand.  In early 2016, looking for a hobby,
            I decided to learn <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> to automate the scoring
            process and to keep historical records.
