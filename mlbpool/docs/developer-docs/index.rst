MLBPool2 Developer Documentation
################################

MLBPool2 is a fantasy baseball like league.  Unlike fantasy baseball, where you need to draft a team and
manage your lineup on a daily basis, in MLBPool2 you will pick teams and players and where you think they
will finish over the course of the Major League Baseball season.  You do not need to set any daily lineups.
View the documentation below to learn how to play MLBPool2.

Developer documentation coming soon.
