# MLBPool2

## How to Play

MLBPool2 is a fantasy baseball like application originally created by
Jason Theros.  MLBPool2 differs from fantasy baseball in that players
make their picks for where they believe teams will place in their division,
individual statistical leaders and which teams will make the playoffs as a
Wildcard before the season starts.  Each pick is worth a specific point
value.  A unique pick (not made by any other player) is worth double
points.  Players can change their picks at the All Star Break, but those
changes are only half their original value.  Unlike fantasy baseball,
players do not need to make daily lineup changes - just sit back and
watch the season unfold!

## MLBPool2 Application

The MLBPool2 application is based on [NFLPool](https://github.com/prcutler/nflpool),
with the major difference is that NFLPool does not allow mid-season
changes.  MLBPool2 is licensed under the MIT license.

## Contributing

MLBPool2 and NFLPool are my first Python applications and I'm sure the
code is ugly in places - contributions welcome!  Please see the
